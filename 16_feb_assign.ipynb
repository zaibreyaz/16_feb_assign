    "\n",
    "        SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are \n",
    "        based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables with defined relationships between them. \n",
    "        This makes them ideal for storing structured data, such as financial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "        NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and do not use a tabular structure. \n",

    "        DROP command is used to delete an existing database object. For example, you can drop a table to remove it from the database.\n",
